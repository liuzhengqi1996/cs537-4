This program writes a special version of the malloc and free library 
routines that checks on common heap and usage mistake.

This program is divided into two modules.

The 537malloc module includes four functions.
malloc537 is a safe malloc method to allocate memory by calling malloc
and store a tuple of address and length in AVL Tree.
free537 is a safe free method to safely free the memory specified by a 
pointer and report error conditions.
realloc537 allocates memory for a pointer, store a tuple of address and
length in AVL Tree.
memcheck537 checks if the address range specified by address ptr and 
length size are fully within a range allocated and memory not yet freed.

The range_tree module includes functions to implement an AVL tree.
Each node has the contain the pointer address, length, left and right 
children of the node, flag to indicate allocated or freed memory and 
height of node.
There are functions to support the functionalities of inserting node, 
deleting node, searching node, and searching range.
